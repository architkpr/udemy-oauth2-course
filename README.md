# OAuth2 Assignments

These assignments are a part of the Udemy course - [Enterprise OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect](https://www.udemy.com/course/enterprise-oauth-for-developers/).

Instead of using Chrome & Postman for understanding OAuth flows, this repository uses Go to make it programmatic while also understanding real-world application development.
